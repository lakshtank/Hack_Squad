# 🔐 Secret Code Feature for Password Reset

## ✅ New Security Enhancement

I've successfully added a **secret code feature** to the forgot password functionality. This provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to enter a 6-digit code sent via email.

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Step 1: Request Password Reset**
1. User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login page
2. User enters their email address
3. System generates a unique 6-digit secret code
4. Email is sent with both reset link AND secret code

### **Step 2: Receive Email**
The email now contains:
- 🔐 **Secret Code**: 6-digit number (e.g., "123456")
- 🔗 **Reset Link**: URL to reset password page
- ⚠️ **Important Note**: User must enter the secret code

### **Step 3: Reset Password**
1. User clicks the reset link in email
2. User enters the 6-digit secret code
3. User enters new password and confirmation
4. System validates secret code before allowing reset

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Database Changes:**
- ✅ Added `secret_code` column to `PasswordReset` table
- ✅ Stores 6-digit numeric code with each reset request
- ✅ Code is validated during password reset process

### **Backend Changes:**
- ✅ Added `generate_secret_code()` function
- ✅ Updated forgot password route to generate and send codes
- ✅ Enhanced email content with secret code
- ✅ Updated reset password route to validate secret code
- ✅ Added server-side validation for security

### **Frontend Changes:**
- ✅ Added secret code input field to reset password form
- ✅ Client-side validation for 6-digit format
- ✅ Real-time validation feedback
- ✅ Updated help text and security notes
- ✅ Enhanced user experience with clear instructions

## 📧 Email Content

The email now includes:

```

## 🧪 How to Test

2. **Request Password Reset**:

   - Copy both the link and the 6-digit code

4. **Reset Password**:
   - Click the reset link
   - Enter the 6-digit secret code
   - Enter new password and confirmation
   - Submit the form

5. **Test Error Cases**:
